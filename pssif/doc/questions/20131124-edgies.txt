What happens if two edges of the same edge type are created between two node instances.
Example1:
 - InfoFlow1 from A to B without Data Objects
 - InfoFlow2 from A to B with Data Objects
Possibilities:
 - Both Edges exist
 - Second edge overwrites first edge (data object is now there)
 - Kaboom!

Example2:
 - InfoFlow1 from A to B, no Auxiliaries.
 - InfoFlow2 from A to B, no Auxiliaries.
Possibilities:
 - Both eixts.
 - Overwrite.
 - Kaboom.
